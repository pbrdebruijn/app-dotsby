# Dotsby Monetization Strategy

**Local-First iOS App | No Subscriptions Required**

---

## Philosophy

The free version must be **genuinely useful**—not a crippled demo. Parents will recommend Dotsby to other tired parents only if it solves their problem without friction. Monetization comes from delight, not desperation.

---

## Recommended Model: Paid Unlock + Tip Jar

### Why Not Subscription?

| Subscription Problems | Dotsby Reality |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Requires ongoing server costs | No servers—100% local |
| Users resent paying monthly for local apps | Parents are already subscription-fatigued |
| High churn after 1-2 years when baby grows | App has natural end-of-life |
| Harder to justify value monthly | One-time feels fair for utility app |

### Why Paid Unlock Works

- Parents use baby apps intensely for 12-24 months, then stop
- One-time purchase feels fair for a "tool"
- No guilt about forgetting to cancel
- Higher perceived value than $2.99/month

## What Makes Free Valuable

The free tier must pass the "recommend to a friend" test. A sleep-deprived parent should be able to:

| Need | Free Delivers |
|------|---------------|
| "Track when baby last ate" | ✓ One-tap feeding log |
| "Know when next nap should be" | ✓ Full wake window calculator |
| "See if baby is sleeping enough" | ✓ 12 weeks of pattern graphs |
| "Remember which breast was last" | ✓ Nursing timer with side tracking |
| "Track diapers for pediatrician" | ✓ Full diaper logging |
| "Get reminded about nap time" | ✓ Local notifications |
| "Monthly photo of baby" | ✓ 24 photos (2 years worth) |

**12 weeks of pattern history is enough** because:
- Most parents care about recent trends, not 6 months ago
- 12 weeks shows seasonal patterns and regressions
- It's genuinely useful, not a teaser

---

## Upgrade Triggers (Soft Prompts)

Show upgrade prompts only at **natural moments of delight or need**—never interrupt workflow.

| Trigger | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| User adds 2nd baby | "Growing family? Unlock unlimited babies with Dotsby+" |
| User scrolls past 12-week history | "See your complete history with Dotsby+" |
| User tries to export | "Export your data with Dotsby+" |
| User takes 25th photo | "Never run out of space—upgrade to Dotsby+" |
| After 30 days of active use | "Enjoying Dotsby? Consider leaving a tip 💛" |
| User shares app | Thank-you message + tip jar mention |

### Prompt Design Principles

1. **Never block functionality**—show prompt, then let them dismiss
2. **Never repeat the same prompt twice in a session**
3. **Never show prompts during active logging** (they're busy!)
4. **Always show what they'll get**, not what they're missing
5. **Make dismissing easy**—big "Not Now" button

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimates

| Metric | Assumption |
|--------|------------|
| Monthly downloads | 1,000 |
| Free to Paid conversion | 8% |
| Average tip | $5 |
| Tip rate (of paid users) | 15% |

### Monthly Revenue (Month 6)

```
Downloads:        1,000/month
Paid conversions: 80 × $9.99  = $799
Tips:             12 × $5.00  = $60
                              ───────
Gross revenue:                 $859/month

Apple's cut (30%):            -$258
                              ───────
Net revenue:                   $601/month
```

### Annual Projection (Year 1)

| Month | Downloads | Paid | Tips | Gross | Net (after Apple) |
|-------|-----------|------|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 200 | $160 | $0 | $160 | $112 |
| 2 | 400 | $320 | $20 | $340 | $238 |
| 3 | 600 | $480 | $40 | $520 | $364 |
| 4 | 800 | $640 | $50 | $690 | $483 |
| 5 | 900 | $720 | $55 | $775 | $543 |
| 6 | 1,000 | $799 | $60 | $859 | $601 |
| 7-12 | ~1,000/mo | ~$800/mo | ~$60/mo | ~$860/mo | ~$600/mo |
| **Year 1** | **~9,000** | **~$7,200** | **~$500** | **~$7,700** | **~$5,400** |

---

## Alternative: "Pay What You Want" Launch

For initial traction, consider launching with:

1. **First 1,000 users:** Everything free (build reviews + word of mouth)
2. **After 1,000:** Introduce Dotsby+ at $9.99
3. **After 5,000:** Add tip jar

This builds goodwill and reviews before monetizing.

---

## In-App Purchase Implementation

### StoreKit 2 Setup

```swift
// Products to configure in App Store Connect
enum DotsbyProduct: String, CaseIterable {
    case premiumUnlock = "com.dotsby.premium"
    case tipSmall = "com.dotsby.tip.small"      // $2.99
    case tipMedium = "com.dotsby.tip.medium"    // $9.99
    case tipLarge = "com.dotsby.tip.large"      // $19.99
}
```

### Restore Purchases

Critical for user trust:
- Prominent "Restore Purchases" button in settings
- Automatic restoration on app reinstall
- Works across user's devices via iCloud

---

## What NOT to Do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Ads | Parents hate ads. Destroys trust. Tiny revenue. |
| Aggressive paywalls | Creates resentment. Bad reviews. |
| Feature-gating core tracking | Makes free version useless. No referrals. |
| Time-limited trials | Pressure tactics feel gross for a baby app. |
| Multiple subscription tiers | Confusing. Parents don't have time to compare. |
| Consumable IAP (pay per export) | Feels nickel-and-dime. |

---

## Competitor Pricing Reference

| App | Model | Price | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| Huckleberry | Freemium + Subscription | $9.99/mo or $59.99/yr | Free is very limited |
| Baby Tracker | Freemium + One-time | $4.99 unlock | Dated but successful |
| Sprout | One-time purchase | $4.99 | No free tier |
| Glow Baby | Freemium + Subscription | $7.99/mo | Aggressive paywalls |

**Dotsby opportunity:** Be the premium-feeling app with fair, simple pricing.

---

## Summary Recommendation

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Model | **Freemium + One-time unlock + Tip jar** |
| Free tier | Genuinely useful (1 baby, 12 weeks, all features) |
| Premium price | **$9.99** one-time |
| Tip options | $2.99 / $9.99 / $19.99 |
| Upgrade prompts | Soft, contextual, never blocking |
| Goal | 8-10% conversion, strong word-of-mouth |

*The best monetization is building something parents love so much they want to pay.*
