## About

Dotsby helps tired parents track their baby's sleep, feedings, diapers, and pumping — then see the patterns emerge over time.

This isn't another overcomplicated baby app with twenty screens and a monthly subscription. Dotsby focuses on what matters: fast logging when you're half asleep, and a clear picture of your baby's day when you need it.

### What You Can Track

1. **Sleep** — Log naps and night sleep with a built-in timer. Track quality, location, and see your baby's schedule evolve over time.
2. **Feedings** — Nursing timer with automatic side tracking. Bottles with volume and type (breast milk or formula). Solids with reaction flagging.
3. **Diapers** — Quick-log wet, dirty, or both with optional color and consistency notes.
4. **Pumping** — Track output by side with a session timer. See daily and weekly totals.

### Smart Sleep Schedule

Dotsby knows your baby's age and calculates wake windows automatically. A progress bar shows how close your baby is to nap time, and you get a gentle reminder 15 minutes before the window closes — so you're never caught off guard.

### Pattern Grid

Dotsby's signature feature is a visual activity grid — inspired by GitHub's contribution graph — that shows your baby's daily intensity at a glance. Tap any day to see the full breakdown. Spot routines, track trends, or just see how much you do every day.

### Milestone Photos

Capture monthly birthday photos and developmental milestones in a dedicated gallery. Dotsby reminds you on your baby's month-day so you never miss one.

### Privacy by Design

Your baby's data is nobody else's business. That's why all your data stays on your device — always. No accounts. No cloud sync. No tracking. No ads.

## Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

### Overview

Dotsby is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your baby's data is yours alone.

### Data Collection

Dotsby does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The app has no backend, no analytics, and no tracking.

### Local Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device using a secure on-device database:
- Sleep, feeding, diaper, and pumping logs
- Baby profiles and birth dates
- Milestone photos
- Timer states
- Reminder preferences
- Theme and unit settings

This data never leaves your device. I cannot access it, and neither can anyone else.

### In-App Purchases

Dotsby uses Apple's StoreKit for the optional Dotsby+ purchase. Apple processes this transaction — no purchase data is collected or stored by Dotsby itself.

### Notifications

If you enable reminders, the app uses your device's local notification system. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.

### Analytics & Tracking

This app does not use:
- Analytics services
- Crash reporting
- Advertising SDKs
- Any third-party tracking

### Third-Party Services

Dotsby does not integrate with any third-party data services. Your data is never shared because it never leaves your device.

### Data Export

The only way data leaves your device is if you explicitly use the CSV Export feature, which generates a local file that you control.

### Data Deletion

You can delete a baby profile and all associated data at any time through Settings. Since data is only stored on your device, deletion is immediate and permanent. Removing the app deletes all data.

### Children's Privacy

Dotsby does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is designed for parents and caregivers, not for use by children.

### Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the new version will be posted in the app and the "Last updated" date will be changed.

### Contact
